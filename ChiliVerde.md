# Nana's Chili Verde   
- 1 doz. blistered peppers (poblanos, anaheim, pasillo, jalapenos?)   
- 1/2 doz tomatillos also blistered  
- single pork butt (~3 lbs) diced in 1" cubes  
- 3 TBS ground cumin  
- 2 regular onins (one enormous)  

Blister the peppers and the tomatillos on the grill.  
Brown paper bag for sweating them as they cool, but over a bowl in order to catch all juices.  
Peel over the same bowl to reserve all possible juices; bowl with peppers will be used later to reserve the pork juices while brazing.  
Chop onions coarsely.  
Dice the pork and braze in large pot (Blue enameled cast iron), little or no oil, when too much liquid accumulates, pour into the pepper reserve bowl to keep brazing of pork.  
When a good amount of pork is nicely browned, pour the peppers, tomatillos, and juices into the pot.  
Add a generous amount of black pepper and three fat figers full of salt.  
Add less water than you might think, really like 2 cups, keeping the level **below** the surface of the solids.  
Simmer covered on low for 2 hours.
